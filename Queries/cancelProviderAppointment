-- Assuming the Provider cancels an appointment with AppointmentID M

-- Retrieving the UserID associated with the appointment
SET @UserID = (SELECT UserID FROM UserAppointment WHERE AppointmentID = M);

-- Moving the appointment details to the Cancelled table
INSERT INTO Cancelled (DateTime, Type, Information, AppointmentSlotID)
SELECT DateTime, Type, Information, AppointmentSlotID
FROM Appointment
WHERE AppointmentID = M;

-- Deleting the user's appointment record
DELETE FROM UserAppointment WHERE AppointmentID = M AND UserID = @UserID;

-- Notify the user with UserID @UserID that their appointment has been canceled
-- You would need to implement the notification mechanism separately, as it's not part of SQL.
